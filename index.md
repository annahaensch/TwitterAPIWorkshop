### Getting Twitter API Credentials

Before you can access the Twitter API you'll need to have a Twitter developer account.  You can apply for access as an academic researcher at the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research/products-for-researchers).

### Command Line API Access with twarc

You can also access the Twitter API through the command line using [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc).  You can install twarc using the [installation guide](https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
